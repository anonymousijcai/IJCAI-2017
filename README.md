# IJCAI-2017

In this repository, we give small and big graphs generated from datalogÂ± knowledge bases.

Note that the small graphs need 2,1 MB of disk space whereas the big graphs need 8,7 GB of disk space.

The big graphs instances were compressed and split into small files of 100 MB (as GitHub only allow for individual files up to 100 MB).

In order to unzip files, just right-click on the .zip files and the process should complete itself automatically.
